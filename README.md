# Supply-Chain-Management(Data Analysis Report created using Excel,PowerBI,Tableau,MYSQL)
## Project Objective
The¬†Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard¬†is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into critical supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders‚Äîincluding logistics managers, procurement teams, and executives‚Äîto make data-driven decisions. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as¬†Order Fulfillment Rate, Inventory Turnover, Delivery Lead Time, and Supplier Performance, along with advanced analytics like¬†Demand Forecasting, Cost-to-Serve Analysis, and Warehouse Efficiency Metrics.

      - In-stock: Inventory in hand is equal to or greater than the minimum stock quantity required.
      - Out-of-stock: Inventory in hand is less than 0 (no stock available).
      - Under-stock: Inventory in hand is less than the desired stock quantity but not entirely out of stock.
