# Supply-Chain-Management(Data Analysis Report created using Excel,PowerBI,Tableau,MYSQL)
## Project Objective
The Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into critical supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders—including logistics managers, procurement teams, and executives—to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Order Fulfillment Rate, Inventory Turnover, Delivery Lead Time, and Supplier Performance, along with advanced analytics like Demand Forecasting, Cost-to-Serve Analysis, and Warehouse Efficiency Metrics.
# Dataset Used
[Dataset](https://github.com/sandhyacherukuri8/Supply-Chain-Management/tree/master/Dataset)
# Questions(KPIs)
1.Total Sales (MTD, QTD, YTD): Tracks the total sales achieved within different time periods

2.Product Wise Sales: Monitors sales figures segmented by individual products or product categories to identify top-performing and underperforming products.

3.Sales Growth: Measures the percentage increase or decrease in sales compared to a previous period (e.g., month-over-month or year-over-year growth).

4.Daily Sales Trend: Analyzes sales performance on a daily basis to spot patterns, peaks, or dips in sales activity.

5.State Wise Sales: Provides sales data broken down by states or geographical areas to identify regional performance trends.

6.Top 5 Store Wise Sales: Highlights the five stores with the highest sales, helping to identify star performers and best practices.

7.Region Wise Sales: Tracks sales across various regions, which may include multiple states or territories, for macro-level performance insights.

8.Total Inventory: Shows the total stock quantity available in hand across all warehouses or locations.

9.Inventory Value: Represents the monetary value of the current inventory based on cost or market value.

10. Categorizes inventory health into three states:
      - In-stock: Inventory in hand is equal to or greater than the minimum stock quantity required.
      - Out-of-stock: Inventory in hand is less than 0 (no stock available).
      - Under-stock: Inventory in hand is less than the desired stock quantity but not entirely out of stock.
      
11.Purchase Method Wise Sales: Breaks down sales based on the method of purchase, such as online, in-store, cash, or credit card.

# Tools Used:
Excel, Tableau, Power BI, MY SQL

# Step-by-Step Process:

1.Data Preparation (Excel Dashboard)

- Utilize the provided Excel data to create an initial dashboard.
- Perform basic data cleaning and transformation.
- Identify key metrics (KPIs) and define data visualization requirements.

2.SQL Integration (Database Setup)

- Load the cleaned Excel files into a SQL database under a well-structured schema.
- Normalize the data to maintain integrity and avoid redundancy.
- Establish primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity.

3.BI Tool Connection (Data Modeling)

- Connect the SQL database to Tableau and Power BI.
- Build a comprehensive data model with necessary joins and relationships.
- Optimize the model for performance by indexing and aggregating data where required.

4.Dashboard Development

- Design interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI.
- Ensure a user-friendly interface with filters, drill-throughs, and tooltips.
- Incorporate advanced analytics, such as trend analysis and forecasting.
