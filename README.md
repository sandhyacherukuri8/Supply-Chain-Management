# Supply-Chain-Management(Data Analysis Report created using Excel,PowerBI,Tableau,MYSQL)
## Project Objective
The Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into critical supply chain operations, enabling stakeholders—including logistics managers, procurement teams, and executives—to make data-driven decisions. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Order Fulfillment Rate, Inventory Turnover, Delivery Lead Time, and Supplier Performance, along with advanced analytics like Demand Forecasting, Cost-to-Serve Analysis, and Warehouse Efficiency Metrics.
# Dataset Used
[Dataset](https://github.com/sandhyacherukuri8/Supply-Chain-Management/tree/master/Dataset)
# Questions(KPIs)
- Total Sales (MTD, QTD, YTD): Tracks the total sales achieved within different time periods

- Product Wise Sales: Monitors sales figures segmented by individual products or product categories to identify top-performing and underperforming products.

- Sales Growth: Measures the percentage increase or decrease in sales compared to a previous period (e.g., month-over-month or year-over-year growth).

  Daily Sales Trend: Analyzes sales performance on a daily basis to spot patterns, peaks, or dips in sales activity.

- State Wise Sales: Provides sales data broken down by states or geographical areas to identify regional performance trends.

- Top 5 Store Wise Sales: Highlights the five stores with the highest sales, helping to identify star performers and best practices.

- Region Wise Sales: Tracks sales across various regions, which may include multiple states or territories, for macro-level performance insights.

- Total Inventory: Shows the total stock quantity available in hand across all warehouses or locations.

- Inventory Value: Represents the monetary value of the current inventory based on cost or market value.

- Categorizes inventory health into three states:
      - In-stock: Inventory in hand is equal to or greater than the minimum stock quantity required.
      - Out-of-stock: Inventory in hand is less than 0 (no stock available).
      - Under-stock: Inventory in hand is less than the desired stock quantity but not entirely out of stock.
      
- Purchase Method Wise Sales: Breaks down sales based on the method of purchase, such as online, in-store, cash, or credit card.
